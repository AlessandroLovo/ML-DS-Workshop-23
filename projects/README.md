# Projects 

In the [Overview talk]() we presented you three different methods that combine dynamicals systems with machine learning. Here, we have a lot of material for you to get started with them. 

## Neural Differential Equations 

[In this notebook](NeuralDifferentialEquations/NeuralDifferentialEquations.ipynb) and its accompyning material, we will get into Neural Differential Equations that integrate Artificial Neural Networks directly into the right hand side of a differential equations. This can be e.g. used to setup a hybrid model that combines prior knowledge with data-driven methods such as ANNs! For the project you'll learn how to use those to approximate chaotic system. You can of course also apply them to actual data. 

## Reservoir Computing
